## MSX Compatible Gateware IP Core

This Implementation of a compatible [MSX] home computer hardware in HDL is the work of [Molekula].

## Overview

The MSX, launched by ASCII Corporation and Microsoft in 1983, aimed to standardize the home computer market, akin to the VHS format for video. Despite its ambitious goals, the MSX found regional success, particularly in Asia, South America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union, but remained largely unknown in the United States. Its architecture, featuring a Zilog Z80A CPU and TMS9918 video processor, made it a versatile platform for both education and gaming.

The acronym "MSX" has sparked much debate over its meaning. Initially, many interpreted it as "Microsoft Extended," a nod to its built-in Microsoft eXtended BASIC. However, Kazuhiko Nishi, a key figure behind the MSX, offered various interpretations over the years, including "Machines with Software Exchangeability" and references to major electronics companies Matsushita (Panasonic) and Sony. Nishi's vision was for a name that signified the system's next-generation capabilities and its association with leading tech giants.

Despite not achieving its goal of global standardization, the MSX left a lasting legacy in the realms of computing and gaming. Before the dominance of Nintendo's gaming consoles, the MSX was a preferred platform for pioneering game developers. The system's versatile architecture and software library made it a beloved platform among enthusiasts, maintaining a dedicated community and influencing generations of users and creators.

## Technical specifications

- **Main CPU:** Zilog Z80 @ 3.579545 MHz
- **Sound Chip:** AY-3-8912 @ 1.789772 MHz
- **Video Resolution:** 256×192 pixels @ 5.369317 MHz
- **Aspect Ratio:** 4:3
- **Video Processor:** TMS9918 or TMS9928 Video Display Processor (VDP)
- **Memory:** 64kB of RAM, expandable through the use of cartridge slots and external peripherals
- **Storage:** Supports floppy disk, cassette tape and cartridge-based storage

## Features

- Reference Model: Philips VG8020/00
- Video Support: NTSC/PAL
- Input: Joystick, Joy2Key and Keyboard
- Sound: Yamaha YM2149 (SSG)
- Memory: 64kB RAM in Slot 3
- Expansion: 2 Cartridge Slots (`.ROM`)
- Supported Mappers:
  - Auto/Mirrored
  - GameMaster2
  - Konami
  - Konami SCC
  - ASCII8
  - ASCII16
  - Linear64k
  - R-TYPE
- BIOS: Supports different BIOS and Hangul BASIC via FWBIOS, by default will use [C-BIOS]

### Status of Features (Not Yet Implemented)

- [ ] Floppy Disk Support (`.DSK`)
- [ ] Cassette Support (`.CAS`)
- [ ] On-Screen Keyboard

## Compatible Platforms

- Analogue Pocket

## Usage

MSX ROMs and BIOS should be placed in `/Assets/msx2/common`.

C-BIOS is not a real BIOS rom and has certain restrictions, such as no support for anything other then cartridges (ROMs). So there is no support for disk, cassette or games that required BASIC.

## Memory limitations

- Slot 1 ROM image max size 4MB
- Slot 2 ROM image max size 4MB
- Slot 3 64Kb RAM
